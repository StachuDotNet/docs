# nxalg.local_efficiency


### nxalg.local_efficiency(ctx: mgp.ProcCtx)
Returns the average local efficiency of the graph.

The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes in a graph is the multiplicative
inverse of the shortest path distance between the nodes. The *local
efficiency* of a node in the graph is the average global efficiency of the
subgraph induced by the neighbors of the node. The *average local
efficiency* is the average of the local efficiencies of each node.


**Parameters**

    * **ctx** (*mgp.ProcCtx*) â€“ The context of the procedure being executed.



**Returns**

The average local efficiency of the graph.



**Return type**

mgp.Record(local_efficiency=float)
