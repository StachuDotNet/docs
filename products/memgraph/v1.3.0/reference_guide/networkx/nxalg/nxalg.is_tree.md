# nxalg.is_tree


### nxalg.is_tree(ctx: mgp.ProcCtx)
Returns `True` if `G` is a tree.

A *tree* is a connected graph with no undirected cycles.

For directed graphs, `G` is a tree if the underlying graph is a tree. The
underlying graph is obtained by treating each directed edge as a single
undirected edge in a multigraph.


**Parameters**

    * **ctx** (*mgp.ProcCtx*) â€“ The context of the procedure being executed.



**Returns**

A boolean that is `True` if `G` is a tree.



**Return type**

mgp.Record(is_tree=bool)
