# nxalg.non_randomness


### nxalg.non_randomness(ctx: mgp.ProcCtx, k: mgp.Nullable.int = None)
Compute the non-randomness of graph `G`.

The first returned value `non_randomness` is the sum of non-randomness
values of all edges within the graph (where the non-randomness of an edge
tends to be small when the two nodes linked by that edge are from two different
communities).

The second computed value `relative_non_randomness` is a relative measure
that indicates to what extent graph `G` is different from random graphs in terms
of probability. When it is close to 0, the graph tends to be more
likely generated by an Erdos Renyi model.


**Parameters**

    
    * **ctx** (*mgp.ProcCtx*) – The context of the procedure being executed.


    * **k** (*mgp.Nullable[int]*) – (default=None)
    The number of communities in `G`.
    If `k` is not set, the function will use a default community
    detection algorithm to set it.



**Returns**

Non-randomness and Relative non-randomness of the graph.



**Return type**

mgp.Record(non_randomness=float, relative_non_randomness=float)
