# nxalg.node\_boundary

## nxalg.node\_boundary\(ctx: mgp.ProcCtx, nbunch1: mgp.List.mgp.Vertex, nbunch2: mgp.Nullable.mgp.List.mgp.Vertex = None\)

Returns the node boundary of `nbunch1`.

The _node boundary_ of a set `S` with respect to a set `T` is the set of nodes `v` in `T` such that for some `u` in `S`, there is an edge joining `u` to `v`. If `T` is not specified, it is assumed to be the set of all nodes not in `S`.

**Parameters**

* **ctx** \(_mgp.ProcCtx_\) – The context of the procedure being executed.
* **nbunch1** \(_mgp.List\[mgp.Vertex\]_\) – List of nodes in the graph representing the set of nodes

  whose node boundary will be returned. \(This is the set `S` from

  the definition above.\)

* **nbunch2** \(_mgp.Nullable\[mgp.List\[mgp.Vertex\]\]_\) – List of nodes representing the target \(or “exterior”\) set of

  nodes. \(This is the set `T` from the definition above.\) If not

  specified, this is assumed to be the set of all nodes in `G`

  not in `nbunch1`.

**Returns**

The node boundary of `nbunch1` with respect to `nbunch2`.

**Return type**

mgp.Record\(boundary=mgp.List\[mgp.Vertex\]\)
