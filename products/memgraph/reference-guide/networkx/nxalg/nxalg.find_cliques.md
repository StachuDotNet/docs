# nxalg.find\_cliques

## nxalg.find\_cliques\(ctx: mgp.ProcCtx\)

Returns all maximal cliques in an undirected graph.

For each node `v`, a _maximal clique_ for `v` is a largest complete subgraph containing `v`. The largest maximal clique is sometimes called the _maximum clique_.

This function returns an iterator over cliques, each of which is a list of nodes. It is an iterative implementation, so should not suffer from recursion depth issues.

**Parameters**

* **ctx** \(_mgp.ProcCtx_\) â€“ The context of the procedure being executed.

**Returns**

An iterator over maximal cliques, each of which is a list of nodes in `G`. The order of cliques is arbitrary.

**Return type**

mgp.Record\(cliques=mgp.List\[mgp.List\[mgp.Vertex\]\]\)
