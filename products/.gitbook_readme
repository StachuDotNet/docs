## Memgraph Cloud

To offer its users more flexibility and a better experience, Memgraph provides fully managed graph DBMS as a service \(in the Cloud\). Users do not need to set up or maintain a database instance. It is Memgraph's responsibility to oversee the infrastructure \(deployment, upgrade, update, removal, data backup, security, etc.\).
